\begin{recipe}{Greek Chicken}{}{}
\Ing{\fr{1}{3} cup olive oil}
\Ing{\fr{1}{3} cup lemon juice}
\Ing{sprinkle of chili powder}
\Ing{3 cloves of garlic}
\Ing{2 large sprigs of rosemary}
\Ing{Salt and pepper}
Strip the rosemary off the sprigs and into a large-ish bowl.
Mince or finely chop the garlic cloves and add them to the bowl,
then add the lemon juice, olive oil, and chili powder.
Put \~4 pinches of salt and around 10 healthy cranks of pepper into 
the bowl.

\Ing{2 chicken breasts}
Slice the chicken breasts so that you have two thin slices of chicken. 
This is to make them not too thick to cook in a pan. Then add them to 
the bowl and cover them in the marinade. At this point you can cover the bowl 
and refrigerate for however long you'd like to marinate for, 
or you can just skip on if you're in a hurry.

\newstep Heat a large pan over a high flame. Pour half of the marinade into 
the pan, wait for it to heat up, then add the chicken and pour the other 
half. Turn the heat down to a low-medium flame and cook for ~10 minutes, turning halfway. 
Then, turn the heat up to high and cook until the chicken and rosemary are charred and delicious.
