\begin{recipe}{Lemon Garlic Chicken}{Serves 4}{2 hours}
\Ing{1/3 cup olive oil}
\Ing{6 cloves of garlic}
\Ing{1 large lemon}
\Ing{1/2 tsp salt}
\Ing{Cracked black pepper}
Pre heat oven to 135C. Mince 2 cloves of the garlic and peel the other 4. 
Add the minced garlic to a bowl. Squeeze ~3 Tbsp of juice from the
lemon into the bowl and slice the remaining lemon. Add the olive oil,
salt and pepper to the bowl and whisk together.
\Ing{1kg chicken breasts}
Pat down the chicken breasts with a paper towel and place them into
a glass or ceramic casserole dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken
and use a spoon to redistribute the marinade until the chicken has been
fully covered. Add the 4 remaining garlic cloves and sliced lemon. 
Cover the dish tightly with foil and cook in oven for 90 minutes. 
After 90 minutes, remove the foil, turn the oven up to 230C, and baste
the chicken with the juices from the bottom of the dish (feel free to
give the juice a little taste too, you can add more pepper or salt 
to taste). Put the chicken back in for 20 minutes without foil
to crisp up the skin.
Serve with beans or other vegetables, with pan drippings spooned over.

You can reduce the number of chicken breasts, but I wouldn't reduce
the amount of marinade by much. Pre-bottled lemon juice can be used
instead of actual lemon, but you won't get nice caramelised lemon slices.
