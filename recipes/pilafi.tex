\begin{recipe}{Pilafi / Pilaf / Pilau}{Serves 2}{40 minutes}
\freeform This is a Turkish-inspired variant of a common middle eastern dish; this is a personal adaptation of a recipe I grew up with as a child that my yaya would cook
\freeform Spice quantities are estimates and should be used to taste, they resemble average ratios I personally use at an estimated quantity

\Ing[0.5]{}{Brown onion}
\Ing[3]{cloves}{Garlic}
Finely chop the onion and garlic, and set aside in a small dish

\Ing[2]{tbsp}{Butter}
Melt the butter in a saucepan over high heat, until the butter starts to brown. Once browning, pour in the onion and garlic and stir for 1 minute or until fragrant

\Ing[0.5]{tbsp}{Turmeric}
\Ing[1]{tbsp}{Cumin}
\Ing[1]{tbsp}{Smoked Paprika}
\Ing[4]{}{Bay leaves}
\Ing[1]{cup}{Basmati rice}
Add spices and rice to the pot and stir until mixed thoroughly, taking care not to break the bay leaves. Leave to cook for 1 minute

\Ing[1]{cup}{Chicken stock}
Pour in the chicken stock and stir until rice is evenly distributed in the pot. Once near a boil, place the lid on the saucepan and switch to a low heat. Leave to cook for 20 minutes

\newstep
Turn off the heat, remove the lid from the pot, and stir to fluff the rice. Leave to sit for 5 minutes then serve after removing the bay leaves



\freeform The following is an optional side that can be served with the pilafi. The chicken can be replaced with vegetarian alternatives.
